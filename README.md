## Development

### Requirements

Unity 4.5.0f6
```

### Unity

Open the root directory as a project in Unity. All used assets are included within the games files.

### Description

This game was developed in Unity 3D using 2Dtoolkit. Nowadays Unity 2D exists, which makes this project somewhat obsolete for studying or building off of. However I'm proud of the video game I created and I hope you find something useful in here!

## Run

To launch the game, run `game.exe`. Enjoy!
